## Bash Scripts to test Watson Services

This folder contains bash scripts that are using **curl** to call watson APIs as explained on Watson getting started pages.

Test whether **curl** is installed. Run the following command on the command line. 

```bash
curl -V
```

If the output lists the curl version with SSL support, you are all set otherwise install it.

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```
